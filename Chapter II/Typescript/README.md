# Typescript

- A Microsoft's open-source language
- Superset of Javascript (meaning Typescript is like Javascript but with more features and functionality)
- Static typing

## Why use Typescript?

- Control of the type of variables, preventing the variable from changing its type during the process
- Prevent sending params with unexpected types to functions, thus allowing you to have more control over the results
